This project is about the Renewable energy forecasting using the Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models. This project is about how the Artificial Intelligence and Data Scinece is improving the Sustainability.
In this project Solar Irradiance, Solar Energy and Wind Energy are predicted using the Machine Learning and Deep Learing algorithms.

The datasets for this project is selected from the Kaggle platfrom. The datasets links are given below:

Solar Irradiance -https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dronio/SolarEnergy
Solar Energy -https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stucom/solar-energy-power-generation-dataset/data
Wind Energy - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mubashirrahim/wind-power-generation-data-forecasting/data

The applied algorithms are Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM and CNN-LSTM. The peformance is validated by the parameters - Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R2 value, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The results shows that Random Forest model performed better in the prediction process.

The interactive software user interface is built using the Gradio.
